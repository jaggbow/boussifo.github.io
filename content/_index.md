Hi, Iâ€™m Oussama! ðŸ‘‹


I am a PhD student at [Mila](https://mila.quebec/) and [UdeM](https://www.umontreal.ca/) working under the supervision of professor [Yoshua Bengio](https://yoshuabengio.org/) on AI for scientific discovery. Prior to this, I obtained my engineering degree in Applied Mathematics and Data Science from [CentraleSupÃ©lec](https://www.centralesupelec.fr/) (2021) and a Msc. in ["Mathematics, Vision & Learning"](https://www.master-mva.com/) (2021) from ENS Paris-Saclay (commonly known as MVA). 

I am interested in developping AI scientists and data-driven physics simulators.
